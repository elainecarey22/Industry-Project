Marine forecast dashboard

A visual representation of current and forecast data for tide heights, water temperature and water salinity.

Uses the Connemara 3D model and EPA Beaches datasets located on the ERDDAP server.

irelandmap.js is the file containing most of the page's functionality (map, ajax requests to remote server)

beaches.geojson contains the locations displayed on the map

salinity.js, temperature.js and tideheight.js contain the code which create the graphs

index.html and irelandmap.css determine the structure, layout and content of the page
